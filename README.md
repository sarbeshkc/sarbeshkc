## 💡 Project Ideas & Interests

While I haven't completed any major projects yet, I'm bursting with ideas and eager to bring them to life using Godot Engine! Here are some areas I'm particularly excited about:

1. **2D Platformer Game**: Developing a game that incorporates Nepali folklore and mythology using Godot's 2D engine.
2. **3D Adventure Game**: Creating an immersive 3D world with Godot's 3D capabilities.
3. **Educational Game**: Designing an interactive game to teach programming concepts to beginners, leveraging Godot's user-friendly interface.
4. **Mobile Puzzle Game**: Building a challenging puzzle game for mobile platforms using Godot's cross-platform export feature.

I'm always open to new ideas and would love to collaborate on Godot projects in these areas or explore entirely new concepts!
