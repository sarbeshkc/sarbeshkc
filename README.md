## 💡 Project Ideas & Interests

While I haven't completed any major projects yet, I'm bursting with ideas and eager to bring them to life! Here are some areas I'm particularly excited about:

1. **2D Platformer Game**: Developing a game that incorporates Nepali folklore and mythology.
2. **System Optimization Tool**: Creating a utility to enhance performance on low-end computers.
3. **Educational Game**: Designing an interactive game to teach programming concepts to beginners.
4. **Community-driven Web App**: Building a platform for Kathmandu University students to share resources and collaborate.

I'm always open to new ideas and would love to collaborate on projects in these areas or explore entirely new concepts!
